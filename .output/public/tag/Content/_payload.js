If you're interested in how I built this site or some of the tools I'm using in my Productivity System, you can check it out below.","I recently rebuilt my site using ","https:\u002F\u002Fnuxt.com\u002Fv3","Nuxt 3.0",", and wanted to use this first post to document my thought process and some other elements of my Productivity System. This site was originally meant to be a minimalist portfolio for highlighting some of the work I've done or am doing, but I ended up adding a blog using ","https:\u002F\u002Fcontent.nuxtjs.org\u002F","Nuxt Content",". I'll probably add more features in the future just because I enjoy experimenting and like the idea of having a central location for testing out cool stuff. Concerning the blog, I will likely stick to longer, more thoughtful posts here, and use a third-party platform to post more technical content, probably ","Other tools I used here include ","tailwindcss.com","Tailwind CSS"," and static site hosting via ","pages.github.com","Github Pages",". You can check out the site repository ","https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fletsbecomehuman\u002Fpersonalwebsite_rebuild","here","Another reason I wanted to create a blog is because I'm in the process of developing a Productivity System and Personal Knowledge Management System, and I think a blog can help towards that end.","Every day we're getting bombarded by more and more content vying for our attention and, personally, I feel without an organized approach reaching my goals might be a little more difficult.","My previous workflow consisted of several apps (Trello, Nextcloud, a todo app, notepad app, and more) but ultimately these systems were too disparate difficult to integrate with each other. While I dabbled with a few solutions I ultimately decided on ","https:\u002F\u002Fobsidian.md",". I'll be honest, it does take some time to get set up and learn all the extensions - my first attempt at transitioning to Obsidian lasted only a couple days before I gave up and went back to my old system. After a month or two, however, I was ready to give it another shot.","I've been using Obsidian for a few months now and I'm pretty sold on it. Like I mentioned above, there's a bit of a learning curve, but the pros really do make it worth it.","If you're interested, here's a list of the extensions I'm currently using:","ul","Advanced Tables","Calendar","Copy button for code blocks","Dataview","Indentation Lines","Natural Language Dates","Outliner","Tag Wrangler","Templater","Zoom","There's a few ways of syncing your Obsidian valuts between your devices, eg Obsidian Publish, github, cloud services or ","https:\u002F\u002Fsynching.net",". I tried both github and a cloud service, but ultimately decided to go with Syncthing after it was recommended on a Reddit post. Syncthing was really able to address a lot of the problems I was having with the other two systems and can't think of a good reason to be using anything else (unless you want to publish your notes publicly, then do check out the paid service Obsidian Publish).","Just wanted to also give ","https:\u002F\u002Fgetpocket.com"," a mention here. It has a great freemium plan and has a great Text to Speech feature I use to listen to articles when I don't feel or am unable to read.
