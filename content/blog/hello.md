<p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">Hi there, thanks for stopping by! If you're interested in how I built this site or some of the tools I'm using in my Productivity System, you can check it out below.</p>


## Blog & Tech Stack

I recently rebuilt my site using [Nuxt 3.0](https://nuxt.com/v3), and wanted to use this first post to document my thought process and some other elements of my Productivity System. This site was originally meant to be a minimalist portfolio for highlighting some of the work I've done or am doing, but I ended up adding a blog using [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). I'll probably add more features in the future just because I enjoy experimenting and like the idea of having a central location for testing out cool stuff. Concerning the blog, I will likely stick to longer, more thoughtful posts here, and use a third-party platform to post more technical content, probably [dev.to](dev.to).

Other tools I used here include [Tailwind CSS](tailwindcss.com) and static site hosting via [Github Pages](pages.github.com). You can check out the site repository [here](https://github.com/letsbecomehuman/personalwebsite_rebuild). 

## Productivity System 

Another reason I wanted to create a blog is because I'm in the process of developing a Productivity System and Personal Knowledge Management System, and I think a blog can help towards that end.

Every day we're getting bombarded by more and more content vying for our attention and, personally, I feel without an organized approach reaching my goals might be a little more difficult.

My previous workflow consisted of several apps (Trello, Nextcloud, a todo app, notepad app, and more) but ultimately these systems were too disparate difficult to integrate with each other. While I dabbled with a few solutions I ultimately decided on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I'll be honest, it does take some time to get set up and learn all the extensions - my first attempt at transitioning to Obsidian lasted only a couple days before I gave up and went back to my old system. After a month or two, however, I was ready to give it another shot. 

### Obsidian

I've been using Obsidian for a few months now and I'm pretty sold on it. Like I mentioned above, there's a bit of a learning curve, but the pros really do make it worth it. 

If you're interested, here's a list of the extensions I'm currently using: 
- Advanced Tables
- Calendar
- Copy button for code blocks
- Dataview
- Indentation Lines
- Natural Language Dates
- Outliner
- Tag Wrangler
- Templater
- Zoom

### Syncthing

There's a few ways of syncing your Obsidian valuts between your devices, eg Obsidian Publish, github, cloud services or [Syncthing](https://synching.net). I tried both github and a cloud service, but ultimately decided to go with Syncthing after it was recommended on a Reddit post. Syncthing was really able to address a lot of the problems I was having with the other two systems and can't think of a good reason to be using anything else (unless you want to publish your notes publicly, then do check out the paid service Obsidian Publish). 

### Pocket

Just wanted to also give [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) a mention here. It has a great freemium plan and has a great Text to Speech feature I use to listen to articles when I don't feel or am unable to read. On top of that Pocket is a Mozilla product, which I support because it is important to have a strong Chrome alternative out there.
