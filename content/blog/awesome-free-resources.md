## Why a Blog?

I recently rebuilt my site using [Nuxt 3.0](https://nuxt.com/v3) and wanted to use this first post to document my thought process and some other elements of my productivity system. It was originally meant to be a minimalist portfolio, but I ended up adding a blog using [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). I'll probably add more features in the future just because I enjoy experimenting and like the idea of having a central location for everything. Concerning the blog, I will likely stick to longer, more thoughtful posts here, and use a third party platform to post more technical content.

## Productivity System 

Another reason behind the creation of this blog is my ongoing goal of creating an efficient productivity system - there are so many platforms that we can be writing on and posting content to, and I felt I needed to narrow down some of the options. This blog, along with one or two other platforms, will be the main places I'll be using to publicly synthesize my experience and progress, something which doesn't come naturally to me. Despite not being a huge fan of writing, I think that it is a good tool for countering some of the other outside demands that many of us feel on our attention.

In an ideal world I would start with a large net regarding content and progressively filter out non-useful information, distilling and processing it along the way, until it ultimately gets documented in a post or some other nicely organized content. The shape of this system would essentially be an inverted triangle with the large end being the messy and chaotic world of content and information and the other being a much smaller and organized set of notes helping to make sense of the former. 

While I don't have a system in place that I'm fully satisfied with, I do have one I'm working on. 

## Obsidian

Obsidian has been a savior for me when it comes to note taking.
